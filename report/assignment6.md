## 1. Introduction

The Computer Tomography Scan (CT Scan) is a medical procedure that involves multiple x-rays analyzed using computer aided techniques. The CT Scan’s creation was credited to Allan M. Cormack and Godfrey N. Hounsfield for which both individuals were awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine [^1]. The OECD estimates that there are a total of 42.64 million scanners located in the United States; the fourth most of any country [^2]. This prevalence is extremely important when discussing a diagnosis for stroke victims. 

The goal of researchers and medical practitioners is to improve upon detection rates to ensure that more lives are saved by early detection. According to Johns Hopkins Medical Department the faster medical precautions can be given to a victim, the better the prognosis is for the individual [^3]. The brain requires a constant supply of blood and oxygen. When it is starved of these nutrients, the brain tissue begins to die. 

## 2. Assisting Researchers with Artificial Intelligence 

According to an article in Radiology Business, automated detection of stroke anomalies is improving. As stated in a review in the article, “the team found convolutional neural networks beat random forest learning on sensitivity, 85% to 68% [^4].” This improvement is an excellent improvement by switching the algorithm that is used to train the model. A convolutional neural network is a deep learning technique while a random forest is a modified decision tree. By modifying approaches from a decision tree to a deep learning technique, there is a very high likelihood that more lives could be saved. Strokes account for nearly 140,000 deaths a year and are one of the leading causes of permanent disability in the United States [^5].

There is an interesting They also found research physicians tend to use random forest learning for early stroke detection but convolutional neural networks for finding large vessel occlusions.
